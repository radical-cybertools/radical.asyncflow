# AsyncFlow â€” Installation Guide

AsyncFlow is a Python library built on top of `asyncio`, designed for orchestrating complex asynchronous workflows easily and reliably.
This guide will help you install AsyncFlow in a clean Python environment.

---

## Prerequisites

* Python â‰¥ **3.9** (recommended: 3.11 or newer)
* `pip` â‰¥ 22.0
* Optional: `conda` â‰¥ 4.10 for Conda environments

Make sure Python is installed on your system:

```bash
python --version
pip --version
```

---

## Installation Options

AsyncFlow supports different installation modes depending on your execution backend needs:

### Core Installation (Local Development)
```bash
pip install radical.asyncflow
```

This provides:
- **`noop`** backend for testing and dry runs
- **`concurrent`** backend for local parallel execution

### HPC Execution Backends
```bash
# All HPC backends
pip install 'radical.asyncflow[hpc]'

# Specific backends
pip install 'radical.asyncflow[dask]'          # Dask distributed computing
pip install 'radical.asyncflow[radicalpilot]'  # RADICAL-Pilot for HPC
```

### Development Installation
```bash
pip install 'radical.asyncflow[dev]'  # Testing and development tools
```

!!! tip "Backend Discovery"
    AsyncFlow automatically discovers available backends at runtime. Missing backends show helpful installation hints when requested.

## Recommended: Create a Clean Environment

It is **strongly recommended** to install AsyncFlow in an isolated environment (Conda or `venv`) to avoid conflicts with system packages.

---

## Install with **Conda**

### Create and activate a Conda environment:

```bash
conda create -n asyncflow python=3.11 -y
conda activate asyncflow
```

### Install AsyncFlow:

```bash
pip install asyncflow
```

### Verify installation:

```bash
python -c "import radical.asyncflow; print('AsyncFlow installed âœ…')"
```

---

## Install with **venv** (built-in)

If you donâ€™t use Conda, you can use Pythonâ€™s built-in `venv` module.

### Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv ~/.venvs/asyncflow
source ~/.venvs/asyncflow/bin/activate
```

(For Windows: `~/.venvs/asyncflow/Scripts/activate`)

### Install AsyncFlow:

```bash
pip install asyncflow
```

### Verify installation:

```bash
python -c "import radical.asyncflow; print('AsyncFlow installed âœ…')"
```

---

## Development Installation (optional)

If you want to contribute to AsyncFlow or use the latest code from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/radical-cybertools/asyncflow.git@devel
cd asyncflow
pip install -e .
```

The `-e` flag installs it in *editable mode* â€” any local changes you make to the code are reflected immediately.

---

!!! tip

* Always activate your virtual environment before using AsyncFlow.
* To deactivate an environment:

  * `conda deactivate` (Conda)
  * `deactivate` (`venv`)
* You can list installed packages with `pip list`.
* It is a good practice to upgrade `pip` and `setuptools`:

  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
  ```
