# RADICAL AsyncFlow (RAF)

**RADICAL AsyncFlow (RAF)** is a fast asynchronous scripting library built on top of [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) for building powerful asynchronous workflows on HPC, clusters, and local machines. It supports pluggable execution backends with intuitive task dependencies and workflow composition. 

- ‚ö° **Powerful asynchronous workflows** ‚Äî Compose complex async and sync workflows easily, with intuitive task dependencies.

- üåê **Portable across environments** ‚Äî Run seamlessly on HPC systems, clusters, and local machines with pluggable execution backends.

- üß© **Flexible and extensible** ‚Äî Supports composite workflows management.

Currently, RAF supports the following execution backends:

- [Radical.Pilot](https://radicalpilot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#)
- [Dask.Parallel](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/)
- [Concurrent.Executor](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#executor-objects)
- Noop with `dry_run`
- Custom implementations

## Basic Usage

```python
import asyncio

from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
from radical.asyncflow import WorkflowEngine
from radical.asyncflow import ConcurrentExecutionBackend

async def run():
    # Create backend and workflow
    backend = await ConcurrentExecutionBackend(ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3))
    async with await WorkflowEngine.create(backend=backend) as flow:

    @flow.executable_task
    async def task1():
        return "echo $RANDOM"

    @flow.function_task
    async def task2(t1_result):
        return int(t1_result.strip()) * 2 * 2

    # create the workflow
    t1_fut = task1()
    t2_result = await task2(t1_fut) # t2 depends on t1 (waits for it)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(run())
```
