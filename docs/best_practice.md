# Best Practices for AsyncFlow

AsyncFlow is built on top of Python’s `asyncio`, combining asynchronous execution and task dependency management with a simple API.  
This page outlines **recommended practices** when using AsyncFlow effectively in your projects.

---

## Why Best Practices Matter

Async programming can easily lead to:

- Hard-to-debug concurrency bugs 🚨
- Deadlocks or race conditions 💥
- Inefficient task scheduling ⚠️

By following these best practices, you can:

- Make your workflows reliable 🏅
- Maximize concurrency 🔥
- Keep code maintainable 🔧

---

## Structure Your Tasks Clearly

- Define **small, composable tasks** that each do one thing well.
- Prefer pure functions or side-effect-free coroutines as tasks.
- Use `@flow.function_task` or `@flow.executable_task` decorators consistently.

!!! tip 

Name your tasks clearly to improve logs and debugging
```python
@flow.function_task
async def fetch_data(url):
    ...
```
---

## Use Dependencies Correctly

Tasks can depend on the output of other tasks:
- Make your dependency graph explicit by passing tasks as arguments.
- Don’t block unnecessarily: let AsyncFlow schedule dependencies.

!!! tip
Tasks that don’t depend on each other run in parallel automatically.

```python
asyncflow = WorkflowManager(dry_run=True)

async def task_a():
    asyncio.sleep(2) # (1)!

async def task_a():
    asyncio.sleep(2) # (2)!

async def task_c(task_a_fut, task_b_fut):
    asyncio.sleep(2)


result = task_c(task_a(), task_b()) # (3)!
```

1. Task A will run asynchronously (independently)
2. Task B will run asynchronously (independently)
3. Task C will wait implicitly for other tasks

---

## Await Only at the Top Level

- Inside your workflow logic, don’t await intermediate tasks.
- Let AsyncFlow build the graph; only await the final or root tasks you care about.
- Awaiting early forces serialization and kills concurrency.

!!! warning

Avoid this as it will be slower:

```python
await task_a()
await task_b()
```
Instead 1 await is faster 🔥:

```python
result = await task_c(task_a(), task_b())
```

---

## Use `await flow.shutdown()`

Always shut down the flow explicitly when finished:
- Releases resources (e.g., thread pools, processes).
- Ensures a clean exit.

At the end of your async main:

```python
await flow.shutdown()
```

---

## Logging & Debugging

Enable detailed logs to diagnose issues:
```bash
export RADICAL_LOG_LVL=DEBUG
```

Logs show task dependencies, execution order, errors.

---

## Clean Shutdown

- Use `try`/`finally` in your async main to ensure `flow.shutdown()` is always called, even on exceptions.

---

!!! success

- Define tasks clearly and concisely.  
- Pass tasks as arguments to express dependencies.  
- Only await at the top level.  
- Shut down cleanly.  
- Log at `DEBUG` level when needed.
