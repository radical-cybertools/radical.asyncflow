# Synchronous vs Asynchronous Programming with AsyncFlow

The goal of this documentation is to demonstrate the power of asynchronous programming enabled by AsyncFlow for both blocking and non-blocking tasks, workflows, and workflow compositions.


## Building Asynchronous Workflows
In the asynchronous approach, we submit all 5 blocking workflows concurrently and wait for their completion.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B[Launch N workflows async]
    B --> C1[Workflow 1]
    B --> C2[Workflow 2]
    B --> C3[Workflow ...]
    B --> C4[Workflow N]
    C1 --> D[Wait for all to finish]
    C2 --> D
    C3 --> D
    C4 --> D
    D --> E[Print total time]
    E --> F[Shutdown WorkflowEngine]
```

!!! success "Performance Benefit"
This approach can significantly reduce total execution time by allowing independent workflows to run concurrently.


### Example Code

```python

import time
import asyncio
from radical.asyncflow import ConcurrentExecutionBackend
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
from radical.asyncflow import WorkflowEngine

backend = await ConcurrentExecutionBackend(ThreadPoolExecutor())
async def main():
    async with await WorkflowEngine.create(backend=backend) as flow:
        @flow.function_task
        async def task1(*args):
            return time.time()

        @flow.function_task
        async def task2(*args):
            return time.time()

        @flow.function_task
        async def task3(*args):
            return time.time()

        async def run_wf(wf_id):
            print(f'Starting workflow {wf_id} at {time.time()}')
            t3 = task3(task1(), task2())
            await t3 # Blocking operation so the entire workflow will block
            print(f'Workflow {wf_id} completed at {time.time()}')

        start_time = time.time()
        await asyncio.gather(*[run_wf(i) for i in range(5)])
        end_time = time.time()

        print(f'\nTotal time running asynchronously is: {end_time - start_time}')


asyncio.run(main())
```

    Total time running asynchronously is: 0.03412771224975586
    Shutdown is triggered, terminating the resources gracefully
    ```


!!! tip "Key Characteristics"
- Workflows execute concurrently
- Total time is determined by the longest-running workflow
- More efficient but requires proper async/await syntax
- Better resource utilization



!!! important "When to Use Each"
- Use synchronous when workflows must run in sequence or have dependencies
- Use asynchronous when workflows are independent and you want better performance
